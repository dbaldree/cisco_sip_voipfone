# Cisco SIP Config for Voipfone (UK Dial plan) #
Working configuration for connecting Cisco 7940G and 7960G phones to VOIPFONE SIP service.

## CISCO SIP FIRMWARE ##
I can't store these files here due to Cisco copyright laws however the four files you need are:

P003-8-12-00.bin  
P003-8-12-00.sbn  
P0S3-8-12-00.loads  
P0S3-8-12-00.sb2  

Include these within the same folder you are using for TFTP as with the other files found here (they are already configured to reference this firware version).
